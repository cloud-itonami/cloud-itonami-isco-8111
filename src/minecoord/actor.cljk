  "MineCoordActor — the ISCO-08 8111 miners and quarriers mine/quarry-
  site scheduling/logistics coordination actor as a
  `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors
  section). One graph run = one coordination operation request
  (intake → advise → govern → decide → commit/hold, with a
  human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite
  internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can
  resume after human sign-off. This actor coordinates MINE/QUARRY-
  SITE SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never performs mining/quarrying
  work itself and never commits a proposal the MineCoordGovernor
  refuses. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7232's aerocoord.actor.

  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the Mine/Quarry-Site Scheduling &
  Logistics Coordination Advisor can never directly commit a
  coordination record the MineCoordGovernor refuses — every
  commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`, and the governor's
  scope-exclusion rule makes any proposal to finalize a mine/quarry-
  operation-execution decision (authorizing extraction/excavation to
  proceed), or override a mine-safety-officer's/site-supervisor's
  judgment, an unconditional, permanent :hold."
