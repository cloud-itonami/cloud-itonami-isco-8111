# Operator Guide

## First Deployment

1. Define the operator's mine/quarry-site roster and miner-registration process.
2. Define consent and purpose categories for logged work records.
3. Run synthetic coordination cases (work-record logging, scheduling, safety-concern flags, supply orders).
4. Enable human-reviewed sign-off for `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions — every safety-concern flag, no exceptions ever, and every above-threshold supply order.
5. Measure coordination outcomes and audit coverage.

## Minimum Production Controls

- consent and disclosure log
- safety-critical escalation path (ground-stability, gas-detection and equipment-condition concerns ALWAYS reach a human — no exceptions, ever)
- provenance for all mine/quarry sites and miners before any coordination action
- human review for high-risk cases
- audit export for all gated actions

## Scope Boundary (Mandatory)

This actor coordinates mine/quarry-site scheduling and logistics
ONLY. Operators must not wire this actor's output into any system
that would let it directly finalize a mine/quarry-operation-execution
decision (authorize extraction/excavation to proceed), or override a
mine-safety-officer's or site-supervisor's judgment — the governor's
closed op-allowlist and scope-exclusion rule are the last line of
defense, not the only one; operator-side integrations must not create
a path around them.

## Certification

Certified operators must prove that the governor gates every
safety-critical robot action, that safety-critical risks escalate to
humans unconditionally, and that no integration allows this actor to
finalize a mine/quarry-operation-execution decision or override
mine-safety-officer/site-supervisor authority.
